## 🧠 Technical Highlights & Learnings
While building this project, I focused heavily on mastering modern React and CSS fundamentals:
1. **Prop Drilling & Dynamic Rendering:** Created master template components (like `DestinationData` and `TripData`) that accept unique props, allowing complex UI sections to be generated dynamically from clean data arrays.
2. **Advanced CSS Positioning:** Utilized `position: absolute` and `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` to perfectly center dynamic text overlays on top of responsive viewport-height images.
3. **Controlled Forms:** Implemented stateful inputs inside the custom `/signup` route to actively manage and capture user data.
4. **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Architected complex side-by-side layouts and responsive image galleries without relying on external libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
